# FineTune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow
I will do the preprocessing and tokenization of data for BERT classification, and build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.
