# FineTune-BERT-for-Text-Classification-with-TensorFlow

I will do the preprocessing and tokenization of data for BERT classification, and build TensorFlow input pipelines for text data with the tf.data API, and train and evaluate a fine-tuned BERT model for text classification with TensorFlow 2 and TensorFlow Hub.

**Steps:**

1.  Download and Import the Quora Insincere Questions Dataset
2.  Create tf.data.Datasets for Training and Evaluation
3.  Download a Pre-trained BERT Model from TensorFlow Hub
4.  Tokenize and Preprocess Text for BERT
5.  Wrap a Python Function into a TensorFlow op for Eager Execution
6.  Create a TensorFlow Input Pipeline with tf.data
7.  Add a Classification Head to the BERT hub.KerasLayer
8.  Fine-Tune and Evaluate BERT for Text Classification
